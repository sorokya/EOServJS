An [Endless Online](http://endless-online.com) Server Emulator written in NodeJS

## Thanks to
* Sausage for making [EOServ](http://eoserv.net)
* Sordie for making [Kalandra/MEOW](http://sordie.tehsausage.com)
* ethanmoffat for making his [open source EO Client](https://github.com/ethanmoffat/EndlessClient)

I've referenced all three of these projects when coding EOServ.js
